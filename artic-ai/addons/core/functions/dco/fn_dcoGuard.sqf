    ARTIC_fnc_dcoGuard: workaround for a DCO Soldier FSM bug (move.fsm). DCO is no longer
    maintained upstream, so this is applied to EVERY local AI soldier, not just ARTIC's.

    When a DCO scripted move stalls, DCO re-issues it with commandFSM, which can run its move
    state machine for a soldier that never had "FSM_startPos" set -> "Undefined variable
    _startPos" errors. Every 10 s this gives each local AI soldier without one his current
    position. Soldiers mid-move already have DCO's value and are never overwritten.
    Players are never touched.
